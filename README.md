# Hello!

## This is my janky web project.. thing

It's based on Windows 7. The code is mostly from 7.css, WinBox.js and DragSelect.js, alongside my own additions for functionality with other things.

You may fork this project, but I don't want carbon copies of **my** work being claimed as your work.

## If there are any inaccuracies or things anyone would like to change, please feel free to create a new issue.
